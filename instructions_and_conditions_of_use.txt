The preprints of these can be found in this github repository.
BIbtex file with the details of these papers is also here.


NOTE:

Emphasis: The code does not equal the methods in Papers 1-3.

The code is an "example" of an application of the methods in Papers 1-3.
We apply "ONE" of the quadratic algorithms described there.
Also, we apply "ONE" of the many possible LST inversions algorithms.
Alternative stopping criteria can be used too.
Watch this space for further improvements and updates.


INSTRUCTIONS:

Examples 1, 2, 3, 4, 5a, 5b, 6a and 6b are discussed in Paper 3.
Run ex1, ex2, ex3, ex4, ex5a, ex5b, ex6a, ex6b to compute probability matrix Psi for these.

Code ex5b also computes and plots probability density matrix psi(t) (a more interesting plot for this example).
If you wish to also compute it for other examples, uncomment the lines at the bottom of the code.

Matrix Psi for these examples is computed using our quadratic algorithm based on Newton's method.
Four other quadratic algorithms are described in our Paper 3 (A11-A14).

The examples above have nonzero rates c_i.
In code ex7, we illustrate a more general case that includes zero rates c_i.
Use this as an example to create your own.
